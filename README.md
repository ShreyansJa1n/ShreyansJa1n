## 👋 About Me
📱 **iOS Software Engineer at Lose It!** building features for 50M+ users and learning what it takes to build health tech that changes lives at scale.

🔭 **Software Development Engineer** passionate about building robust, scalable systems across the full stack – from enterprise backend services to delightful iOS experiences.

🎓 Currently pursuing my **Master's in Computer Science** at Northeastern University (Boston) with a perfect 4.0 GPA.

💼 **2 years at Trellix** optimizing mission-critical security systems, debugging enterprise infrastructure, and building solutions that serve thousands of users globally.

🧑‍🏫 **Teaching Assistant** for Theory of Computation – helped 200+ students tackle complex algorithms while mentoring junior TAs.

☁️ **DevOps & Cloud Enthusiast** – I love architecting Kubernetes clusters, building CI/CD pipelines, and making deployments seamless across AWS infrastructure.

🏗️ **Full-Stack Creator** – Whether it's event-driven microservices with Kafka, real-time iOS apps with SwiftUI or UIKit, or distributed systems at scale, I enjoy solving complex problems with elegant solutions.

📊 **Data Pipeline Builder** – From financial data streaming platforms to analytics warehouses, I turn raw data into actionable insights.

📸 **Former Lead Photographer** at NIIT University – managed a 60+ member team and discovered my love for capturing moments (both through lenses and code!).

🚀 **Always Learning** – Currently exploring Go, diving deeper into distributed systems, and constantly seeking new challenges that push my limits.

💡 **Philosophy**: I'm a learn-it-all, not a know-it-all. Every bug is a learning opportunity, every project teaches something new.
